#  MoodMe Internship Face-Detection App 

- Face detection app, detects the faces in the picture that the user uploaded to the page, and tell user the percentage of accuracy. 
- In this project I used face-api.js-models
- After uploading a picture to the application, the faceapi loads and detects all faces in the picture you uploaded, then a blue canvas shown on the picture, above the canvas there is a number which is the percentage of accuracy. Inside the canvas the face detected parts shown in purple color.
